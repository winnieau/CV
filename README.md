Junior full-stack developer with an eye for design and a diverse background ranging from creative writing and street performance to personal fitness instruction and junior olympic training.

I am seeking a work environment that allows me to be myself and values me for my ability to make unique contributions. The ideal work-place would provide ongoing opportunities for learning while taking an interest in the mental health of its employees. As long as I am stimulated, valued and interested in my work, I will go in every day giving 110%.

Skills
---

**Full Stack developer**

I began my exploration of programming by doing as many free online tutorials as possible on HTML, CSS and Ruby. Once I knew I had found my calling I applied to Makers Academy, the coding bootcamp. There I practiced TDD/BDD (using testing frameworks like RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine and Protractor) and version control (e.g. git) daily. Furthermore, I learned the importance of concepts like building a Minimum Viable Product, writing clear and concise user stories and constructing cohesive Domain Models, along with hours of remote pair-programming, mob programming and efficient git flow.

For the applications we built, we used two primary language stacks: Ruby and JavaScript. As a developer, I strive to write code that is self-explanatory (thus easily readable without excessive comments) and maintainable because I recognize the inevitability of change in a face-paced world that is becoming more reliant on technology by the day.


Project examples
---


- Built AgileVentures WebSiteTwo [app](https://evening-oasis-1495.herokuapp.com/) with my cohort at Makers Academy for our final project using Ruby on Rails and a postgresQL database to persist user information.

   For the project, I played a large part in the UI/UX, spending extra time outside of group work to ensure that the website looked nice and was layed out in a logical manner. I am a strong proponent of emphasizing clean function with responsiveness first and allowing a simple but elegant design follow.

- Built Blackjack [app](https://pure-refuge-7844.herokuapp.com/) in two days with my Makers cohort. We used Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and JQuery during which I served on the front-end team and was the main contributor for HTML and CSS code.

- Built Thermostat [app](https://github.com/winnieau/Thermostat3) with the other members of Ronin. For the version of the project featured in my github repository, I did all of the CSS and contributed to writing Jasmine tests and the JavaScript logic.
