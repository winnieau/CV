Junior full-stack developer with an eye for design and a diverse background ranging from creative writing and street performance to personal fitness instruction and junior olympic training.

I am seeking a work environment that allows me to be myself and values me for my ability to make unique contributions. The ideal work-place would provide ongoing opportunities for learning while taking an interest in the mental health of its employees. As long as I am stimulated, valued and interested in my work, I will go in every day giving 110%.

Skills

**Full Stack developer**

I began my exploration of programming by doing as many free online tutorials as possible on HTML, CSS and Ruby. Once I knew I had found my calling I applied to Makers Academy, the coding bootcamp. There I practiced TDD/BDD (using testing frameworks like RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Karma and Protractor) and version control (e.g. git) daily.  Furthermore, I learned the importance of building a Minimum Viable Product, writing clear and concise user stories and constructing cohesive Domain Models, along with how to effectively pair(or mob) program with efficient git flow.

For the applications we built, we used two primary language stacks: Ruby and JavaScript. As a developer, I strive to write code that is self-explanatory (thus easily readable without excessive comments) and maintainable, even though sometimes it is hard to know what exactly that entails. The only certainty seems to be that change is inevitable in this fast-paced world that is becoming more reliant on technology by the day, and we should try our best to make room for it. 


Project examples

- Built AgileVentures WebSiteTwo [app](https://evening-oasis-1495.herokuapp.com/) with my cohort at Makers Academy for our final project using Ruby on Rails and a PostgreSQL database to persist user information.

   For the project, I played a large part in the UI/UX, spending extra time outside of group work to ensure that the website looked nice and was layed out logically. I am a proponent of emphasizing clean function with responsiveness first and allowing a simple but elegant design to follow. As someone who really values an aesthetically pleasing webpage, it is hard not to jump right into HTML and CSS immediately, but the wait pays off when you get everything working the way it should before you implement any additional design.

   Research shows that people tend to go to a website with the intention of getting something done, so as developers our first priority should be to make those tasks easier for them to accomplish. Regardless of how pretty it looks, nobody wants to spend valuable time trying to figure out how to navigate your site or app. Once the foundation is layed for responsiveness and easy navigation, then the CSS can be applied to make it more appealing. Chances are, having the functionality sorted out beforehand will even facilitate the design process. 

- Built Blackjack [app](https://pure-refuge-7844.herokuapp.com/) in two days with my Makers cohort. We used Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and JQuery during which I served on the front-end team and was the main contributor for HTML and CSS code. [See the repository](https://github.com/winnieau/blackjack)

- Built Thermostat [app](https://github.com/winnieau/Thermostat3) with the other members of Ronin. For the version of the project featured in my github repository, I did all of the CSS and contributed to writing Jasmine tests and the JavaScript logic.
